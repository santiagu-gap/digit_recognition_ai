# Digit Recognition with AI

Welcome! This project was born out of my curiosity about how AI works behind the scenes. I decided to explore hand-written digit recognition, and I explained in-depth my findings in an article.

If you're interested in learning more or want to set up the digit recognition system on your own device, I've also created a step-by-step tutorial for you to follow.
