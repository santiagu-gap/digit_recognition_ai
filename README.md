Hello! 

I was curious about how AI works behind the scenes so [I made an article diving deep into how Digit Recognition works](https://medium.com/@santiagu.gap/uncovering-the-magic-1-c1c7e23f836a).

This is the code I used in the article about digit recognition.

If you're curious about setting it up on your own device, [follow this tutorial I made](https://medium.com/@santiagu.gap/how-to-test-out-the-digit-recognition-ai-that-i-built-b74897ab1086).
